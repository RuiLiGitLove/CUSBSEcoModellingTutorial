    "1. Sometimes the dynamics of a process are sufficient to give us useful information, i.e. we might care about where a system is stable, or how quickly a quantity is dissipated or grows. We can get many of these properties instantly from inspection of the parameters in  a differential equation.\n",

Sometimes an equation can be constructed from an understanding of the phenomenon, but a closed form integral solution can be difficult or impossible to derive (try integrating the Lotka-Volterra equations!). It's pretty easy to solve differential equations numerically, so this representation can be sufficient.\n",
